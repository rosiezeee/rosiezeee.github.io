                        <p>I have a fear of not being good enough. Throughout my childhood my family, my friends, all the people in my life would talk about my appearance as some sort of achievement. When I was 10 I hit a really awkward stage with all the hardships of becoming a pre teen and I gained a significant amount of weight, grew 4 inches in one summer, my face got pimply, and I realized that being a pretty person isnâ€™t going to get me anywhere.</p>

                        <p>"Act as if" is one of my favorite platitudes. I was a teenager when I first heard it, from a friend's Mom, who I met in High School. She was newly in recovery / AA. Had been a cocaine doing / whiskey drinking elementary school teacher, and she was funny, wise, dry, candid and warm. </p>

                            <p>When I got off the plane and entered the terminal of Domodedovo Airport, the first thing I did was use the restroom. I was one of the last passengers to disembark, so by the time I came out of the toilets, most of my fellow travelers from Dulles to Moscow had disappeared, presumably in the direction of passport control.</p>

She had injured her back some time ago and has been suffering from this. I had seen her with heavy groceries carried in a stroller. I didn't believe her injury. And tonight, seeing boxes upon boxes that had once filled our apartment, there's no way anyone could have believed one with an injured back had assembled quite a fort by herself. I hadn't known how much nine years of accumulation and living looked like, now here it is. </p></div><a href="accumulation.html"><div class="readmore"><h12>read more >></h12></div></a></div>

                            <p>It is supposed that fears can be divided into two camps: rational and irrational. I don't hold with camping on principle, but I guess people need to find their own ways through the wood of life. So here are my two fears. You may categorize them as you see fit. 1) It is the year 2020, and NASA has just received a massive reboot. With their funds they decide to launch a new and improved space station into orbit. By happenstance, I am one of the few people qualified to woman it. </p></div><a href="laura.html"><div class="readmore"><h12>read more >></h12></div></a></div>

                    <h2>ACT AS IF</h2></div></a>

                <div class="storytext">
                        <p>"Act as if" is one of my favorite platitudes. I was a teenager when I first heard it, from a friend's Mom, who I met in High School. She was newly in recovery / AA. Had been a cocaine doing / whiskey drinking elementary school teacher, and she was funny, wise, dry, candid and warm. Something happened to get her to recovery, but I don't know what. She told me to act as if. She was in her first few years of sobriety and when she met me I was a 16-year-old extrovert living timidly. I was terrified to tell my parents the truth—that I didn't believe in what they believed in. I had tried—and it had never gone well, so I went along with the game. </p>

                        <p>Honesty always made my life harder, and more restricted, so my life became about compliance and illusions. I made my thoughts invisible, I hid records, snuck in secret boyfriends late at night through my window. I got a file cabinet that had a locked drawer for all my notes and writings. I got a post office box to get records, zines, and letters from friends. I lived in fear of discovery because I didn't want to have love withheld or be sent away. The fear was a constant companion, a knot in the gut. I was just a secular teen in love with punk rock culture. I wish it was an act of bravery that broke me out of my hiding and my shame, but it wasn't. That Mom told me I could 'act as if' and have something different, that I didn't need to live a lie. </p>

                        <p>After I turned 18 I was supposed to become an evangelical missionary student in another town. I knew it couldn't happen. I didn't know how to say so, but I knew how to survive, and so that's what I did. I packed up everything I owned, and acted as if I owned my own life, and I disappeared from that house, on that gravel road, in that crappy small town. I was released from the fear of being found out and the illusion was blown apart. I got free. </p></div></div>

                <h2>DOMODEVOVO AIRPORT</h2></div></a>
                <div class="storyauthor">
                <h3>by Benjamin Struve</h3></div>
                <div class="storytext">
                            <p>When I got off the plane and entered the terminal of Domodedovo Airport, the first thing I did was use the restroom. I was one of the last passengers to disembark, so by the time I came out of the toilets, most of my fellow travelers from Dulles to Moscow had disappeared, presumably in the direction of passport control.</p>
                            <p>I followed the bilingual signs for Immigration and Passport Control. Like many international terminals, Domodedovo segregates arriving passengers from departing ones, so the passageways were curiously quiet. Eventually though I arrived in the immigration hall, which was another story entirely. There was no line, and not a single one of those retractable, reconfigurable barriers that are the hallmark of orderly queues around the world. Instead there was a throng of humanity, packing into a surprisingly confined space, pressing forwards towards a red line on the floor. Beyond the red line stood a half dozen booths, maybe half of them occupied by border control officers.</p>
                            <p>They were all women, in light blue shirts with epaulettes and tall peaked caps of green felt with red piping. In my memory, into which they became engraved, they are impossibly tall and stern. The throng that separated myself from them was densely packed – less shoulder to shoulder than elbow to rib. The room was only perhaps half full, but there were at least two hundred people between me and the women in the green caps.</p>
                            <p>I walked to the back of the crowd and settled in for a wait. Steadily the throng grew and enveloped me, until I was surrounded by men, uncountable, in every direction. As I remember it, it took sometime before I realized that in fact, they were all men. None of them, frankly, looked as though they had been on the United flight from Dulles. Their passports were unfamiliar colors – light blue, Kyrgyzstan; or green, Uzbekistan. I wondered if I was in the right place – had I ended up in the wrong hall? Was this perhaps the section for citizens of the former USSR, who have their own visa and immigration policies when travelling to Russia? But the signage didn’t seem to indicate that. By this point enough new arrivals had packed in behind me that I didn’t dare leave to explore – if I had to come back, the wait would be at least twice as long.</p>
                            <p>So I set my eyes front and focused on the original goal – the red line and booths beyond. Both seemed agonizingly distant. I felt like the ebb and flow of people behind and in front, the buffeting and jostling as hips turned, the pokes of errant knees and elbows. The worst though was the gradual pressure of shoulder sliding on shoulder followed by a gentle knock as the offender’s scapula settled against my chest or bicep. That was the tactile signature of defeat, of regression. That meant that a more determined foe had moved from behind me in the throng to in front of me, and that the finish line was growing not inexorably closer, as the logic of a line promises, but in fact further away.</p>
                            <p>It was, so to speak, crushing. All the foreignness of the situation was nothing compared to this singular terror, the sense that this could, in fact go on forever, that this was not a passive wait to be endured but an active combat which could not be declined except in absolute forfeiture. </p>
                            <p>The passport officers were not happy with the pushing. Periodically one would emerge from a booth and yell at the crowd to back up behind the red line. But more often they would take breaks, rotate positions, inexplicably disappear, or simply do paperwork at their desks for minutes at a time between passengers. The capricious slowness of the process seemed to only incense the crowd. It reinforced my sense of vulnerability and contingency, the feeling I might not ever get through. Alternative plans flashed through my mind. Should I push through to the front? Claim some special privilege as an American? That seemed incredibly arrogant. Should I ask for help? Call someone? I was paralyzed though, physically and mentally, by the humanity around me and the sensation of moving backwards every time someone edged into a superior position relative to myself.</p>
                            <p>In the end I did get through, by pushing back as much as I was pushed, keeping my stance wide and my elbows vigilant. It took two and half long hours. When my turn finally came at the window, I was processed in seconds, the officer not even bothering to ask the purpose of my visit. She did not betray the slightest indication that I was out of place or that I ought to have done anything differently. It was anticlimactic – I had been expecting some explanation for the exhausting experience I had just undergone. But there was none forthcoming, and I felt guilty at my instinctive expectation that it was extraordinary or wrong for me as an American to go through the same thing that hundreds of others evidently did to enter Russia.</p>
                            <p>Of course, it was wrong – I learned later that there was another passport control hall for passengers arriving from Europe and North America. Probably it had orderly lines delineated by those retractable barricades. Presumably people there did not need to stand nut to butt to avoid being overtaken by more motivated travelers. Somehow though I had missed that hall and ended up in the other one. When it was over, the whole thing was just an inconvenience. But in the thick of it, it had been a novel flavor of fear.

                        <p>I think it all boils down to sudden, loud noises. Hearing a train in the distance sends chills down my spine, but it's the blaring blast of a horn on a nearby train that makes me scream out loud EVERY TIME.</p>

                        <p>A cold gust of wind is uncomfortable, but it's the sound of it whipping past my ear that sends me into fight or flight mode.</p>

                        <p>Same goes for the takeoff and landing on airplanes, someone shouting on public transit, and weirdly enough, the sound of my own voice projecting to a respectfully quiet audience. Loud noises, especially when unexpected, are terrifying!</p></div></div>

                <p>Fear and I go way back. I've been a perfectionist for as long as I can remember. You can't fail if you don't even start, right? The struggle with fear is probably the thing that has held me back more than anything else.</p>

                        <p>For a long time I was afraid that I wasn't good enough to be an "artist," so I worked boring office jobs for over a decade until the pain of not making art was greater than my fear. I slowly started making art on the side, and taking printmaking classes at a community college. The scariest thing I've ever done was leaving that stable, "good" job to return to school to finish my art degree. I had to leave it in stages, reducing my hours from 50 to 30 to 20 over a couple of years, until I finally quit. Telling my boss I was leaving was terrible. I felt like I was going to vomit, and my voice shook as I spoke to him. But after it was done, I felt like a giant weight had lifted, and I could do anything I wanted. Euphoria! I wish I had done that much sooner. I regret all of the years I wasted not working toward goals that are important to me.</p>

                        <p>Even now that I'm doing exactly the thing I wanted to do for years, fear plagues me. I worry that I'll never get a design job, or that I'll hate it, or that my skills aren't good enough, or I'm not creative enough, or that I'm too old. I worry a lot about my future. Day to day, fear sometimes gets in the way of making the things I want to make. I'm afraid what I make will be terrible, so it's easier to not start, or to wait until the last minute until I'm forced into action. I suspect this is a common problem, but it often feels like everyone else has it together, and I'm the only one who struggles with this.</p>

                        <p>Anything I've ever done that involved risk and fear has turned out great, but it's hard to remember that in the moments I'm experiencing fear. I think my work would be a lot better if I could tackle this problem, and I would probably be happier. </p></div></div>

                <div class="storytext">
                        <p>Back in October I suffered an acute head trauma playing the sport that I love (roller derby). It was to the degree that I had to stay home, doing nothing for a month. I couldn't use the computer or even read a book. Which meant dropping my classes and taking a lot of time off from work. Since then my brain power seems to be about half strength-- I forget things constantly (like simply words during conversations) and have to spend about twice as much time when learning new things. </p>

                        <p>I used to have very little fear of failure and now I feel myself constantly anxious that I am going to fail at every little thing-- saying the wrong word, being late to class, having my project suck, getting so dizzy that I can't continue doing a presentation, etc. I know that it's a lot of pressure to put myself under, but I can't make it stop. My brain literally won't let me. </p>

                        <p>I'm so afraid that I'm not going to be able to get through my classes and graduate. Every little molehill looks like a mountain right now. </p></div></div>

                            <p>Most of the biggest "fears" that I've experienced are more psychological or personality driven, like my OCD, where I believe things that aren't. To me fear isn't something that is always in plain sight (although in 2017 it seems to be on my television a lot). To me fear is the creeping feeling that something is wrong or off, a furnace in the back of your mind that you left on. There's a prompt, then the fear feeds itself. It's somewhere but not really there, if that makes sense.</p>

                             <p>Then the anxiety comes. And the dread. It bleeds into your day, hurts your interactions with people. Some hours your workload becomes inexistent and you feel like you're trapped in your own personal purgatory.</p>

                             <p>Needless to say, it fucking sucks.</p>

                             <p>In my experience the only way to deal with it is to confront it. Accept it. Let it scare parts of you until you can take the control the fear has taken back. Then you punch that fear in its face.</p></div></div>

                  <p>Ever since I was a child I've been afraid of Fire Alarms. I'm not entirely sure why, perhaps its the sudden jolt you get when it starts and the continual annoying noise that persists as it continues. Either way, I was terrified of them.</p> <p>It came to a head when I was in 6th grade. The principal liked to maintain constant scheduling so the fire drills were always on the first Thursday of the month, always in the morning. It was always at that time when my class was scheduled to go to the computer lab. On those mornings we solemnly would walk in a line across the school, quiet as not to disturb the other classes. The computer lab was in a large room, there was one alarm in there right above where I was assigned to sit. At first I knew nothing of the scheduling, the lead up to the alarm going off was peaceful, and the eventual sounding of the alarms surprising. However, once I caught wind of the scheduling it became pure torture. We would walk in, I would beg my teacher not to sit me there, but to seat me on the other side of the room She always refused, and as always the alarm went off. I did not have a fun time in 6th grade. </p><p>For me the true fear is anticipation, that something bad will happen, a loud noise, or something more even more sinister. </p></div></div>

I am fearful of those moments when all is lost and you don't know what to do, who to turn to, or when to speak up. I am fearful of losing someone so valuable to something that could've been prevented. I am fearful of my dreamt up kids not knowing their uncle. I am fearful of those who do not open up, who are incapable of putting trust in others, and who do not believe that they can make a difference. </p><p>I am fearful of the future for it is dark just like the past. I am most fearful of knowing that I haven't faced the worst of it. Fear is a word we use when we don't know what to say. It reflects the past, present, and future. Fear is a threat we make up for ourselves. I am fearful in accepting these things.</p></div></div>

                <div class="storytext">
                            <p>On July 7, 1986 I was set on fire by my mom's boyfriend. I spent months in and out of the hospital, more surgeries than I can remember. It changed my life forever and started my addiction to drugs. When I told my mother, she didn't believe me, and I not only went home to this person, he became the care giver and was the one to change bandages and clean the wounds. I have scars on my neck, arm and chest where I was burned to bone.</p>

                            <p>How I overcame this.... Well I still am very uncomfortable around large fires...I don't think I will ever go camping. But I can start a small contolled fire in a fire place or grill if I have a large bucket of water or a fire extinguisher close by. Gas fire places no longer bother me. Mind you all of this has happened in the last couple years and started by turning on a gas fire place and then turning it off when I just couldn't handle it anymore. The next day I would do it for longer. Then when that was no longer so scary I went to a gas grill and did the same thing. Then a fireplace. Which was the hardest. I threw alot of water and my shop vac got alot of use. I still panic when I feel that it;s too big. Why did I do this you might ask? 1. That man who hurt me can't win. I can't let his actions dictate my life. He doesn't get that control. 2. My kids grew up knowing I didn't do fire. I can still see thier faces when I not only started one but had them make smores. His actions don't get to impact their lives.</p>

                            <p>Side note becuase everyone asks. The man who set me on fire died when I was 18. He was run over by a train. My mother never believed me, and I didn't tell anyone else for years. I got sober when I was 16 and have been sober since. I can light candles, I don't do it often. My kids always had candles to blow out on their birthday, even when doing so would give me panic attaks and nightmares.</p></div></div>

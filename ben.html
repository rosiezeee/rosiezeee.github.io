                            <p>When I got off the plane and entered the terminal of Domodedovo Airport, the first thing I did was use the restroom. I was one of the last passengers to disembark, so by the time I came out of the toilets, most of my fellow travelers from Dulles to Moscow had disappeared, presumably in the direction of passport control.</p>
                            <p>I followed the bilingual signs for Immigration and Passport Control. Like many international terminals, Domodedovo segregates arriving passengers from departing ones, so the passageways were curiously quiet. Eventually though I arrived in the immigration hall, which was another story entirely. There was no line, and not a single one of those retractable, reconfigurable barriers that are the hallmark of orderly queues around the world. Instead there was a throng of humanity, packing into a surprisingly confined space, pressing forwards towards a red line on the floor. Beyond the red line stood a half dozen booths, maybe half of them occupied by border control officers.</p>
                            <p>They were all women, in light blue shirts with epaulettes and tall peaked caps of green felt with red piping. In my memory, into which they became engraved, they are impossibly tall and stern. The throng that separated myself from them was densely packed – less shoulder to shoulder than elbow to rib. The room was only perhaps half full, but there were at least two hundred people between me and the women in the green caps.</p>
                            <p>I walked to the back of the crowd and settled in for a wait. Steadily the throng grew and enveloped me, until I was surrounded by men, uncountable, in every direction. As I remember it, it took sometime before I realized that in fact, they were all men. None of them, frankly, looked as though they had been on the United flight from Dulles. Their passports were unfamiliar colors – light blue, Kyrgyzstan; or green, Uzbekistan. I wondered if I was in the right place – had I ended up in the wrong hall? Was this perhaps the section for citizens of the former USSR, who have their own visa and immigration policies when travelling to Russia? But the signage didn’t seem to indicate that. By this point enough new arrivals had packed in behind me that I didn’t dare leave to explore – if I had to come back, the wait would be at least twice as long.</p>
                            <p>So I set my eyes front and focused on the original goal – the red line and booths beyond. Both seemed agonizingly distant. I felt like the ebb and flow of people behind and in front, the buffeting and jostling as hips turned, the pokes of errant knees and elbows. The worst though was the gradual pressure of shoulder sliding on shoulder followed by a gentle knock as the offender’s scapula settled against my chest or bicep. That was the tactile signature of defeat, of regression. That meant that a more determined foe had moved from behind me in the throng to in front of me, and that the finish line was growing not inexorably closer, as the logic of a line promises, but in fact further away.</p>
                            <p>It was, so to speak, crushing. All the foreignness of the situation was nothing compared to this singular terror, the sense that this could, in fact go on forever, that this was not a passive wait to be endured but an active combat which could not be declined except in absolute forfeiture. </p>
                            <p>The passport officers were not happy with the pushing. Periodically one would emerge from a booth and yell at the crowd to back up behind the red line. But more often they would take breaks, rotate positions, inexplicably disappear, or simply do paperwork at their desks for minutes at a time between passengers. The capricious slowness of the process seemed to only incense the crowd. It reinforced my sense of vulnerability and contingency, the feeling I might not ever get through. Alternative plans flashed through my mind. Should I push through to the front? Claim some special privilege as an American? That seemed incredibly arrogant. Should I ask for help? Call someone? I was paralyzed though, physically and mentally, by the humanity around me and the sensation of moving backwards every time someone edged into a superior position relative to myself.</p>
                            <p>In the end I did get through, by pushing back as much as I was pushed, keeping my stance wide and my elbows vigilant. It took two and half long hours. When my turn finally came at the window, I was processed in seconds, the officer not even bothering to ask the purpose of my visit. She did not betray the slightest indication that I was out of place or that I ought to have done anything differently. It was anticlimactic – I had been expecting some explanation for the exhausting experience I had just undergone. But there was none forthcoming, and I felt guilty at my instinctive expectation that it was extraordinary or wrong for me as an American to go through the same thing that hundreds of others evidently did to enter Russia.</p>
                            <p>Of course, it was wrong – I learned later that there was another passport control hall for passengers arriving from Europe and North America. Probably it had orderly lines delineated by those retractable barricades. Presumably people there did not need to stand nut to butt to avoid being overtaken by more motivated travelers. Somehow though I had missed that hall and ended up in the other one. When it was over, the whole thing was just an inconvenience. But in the thick of it, it had been a novel flavor of fear.

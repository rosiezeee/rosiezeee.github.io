        <h1>Logical Fallacies</h1>
	</header>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Fallacies are misleading types of arguments. Many or them are tempting to use, and therefore so common that they have names. To call something a fallacy is just another way of saying that it violates at least one of the rules for good arguments. Here is a short list and explanation of some of the classical fallacies. Know them in order to avoid them!</h2>
		
        
        <article>
            <h3>ad hominem</h3>
            <p class="latin">"to the man"</p>
			<p>
            Attacking the person of a source rather than his or her qualifications or reliability, or the actual argument he or she makes. </p>
               <p class="example">Mother: Smoking is harmful to your health. <br> Daughter: But you smoke, Mom, so how can you say that? </p>
            <p>The daughter is addressing the person rather than the actual argument.</p>
            
            
            <h3>ad ignorantiam</h3>
            <p class="latin">"appeal to ignorance"</p>
			<p>
            Arguing that a claim is true just because it has not been shown to be false. A common example of this is a comment made by Senator Joseph McCarthy when he was asked for evidence to back up his accusation that a certain person was a Communist.</p>
            
            <p class="example">I do not have much information on this except the general statement of the agency that there is nothing in the files to disprove his Communist connections.</p>
            <p>This is similar to a guilty until proven innocent approach, which is a difficult if not impossible approach to defend.</p>
            
              <h3>ad misericordiam</h3>
            <p class="latin">"appeal to pity"</p>
			<p>
            Appealing to pit as an argument for special treatment.</p>
            
            <p class="example">I know I flunked every exam, but if I don't pass this course, I'll have to retake it in summer school. You have to give me a passing grade.</p>
            
            <h3>ad populum</h3>
            <p class="latin">"appeal to masses"</p>
			<p>
            Appealing to the emotions of a crowd, or appealing to a person to go along with the crowd.</p>
            
            <p class="example">Everyone's doing it.</p>
            <p>
            No reasons are offered to show that "everybody" is any kind of reliable source.</p>
            
              <h3>affirming the consequence</h3>
            <p class="latin">if P then Q. Q. Therefore, P.</p>
			<p>
            A mistaken conclusion of modus ponens deductive reasoning.</p>
            
            <p class="example">When the roads are icy, the mail is late. <br><br>The mail is late. <br><br> Therefore, the roads are icy.</p>
            <p>Although the mail would be late if the roads were icy, it may be late for other reasons too. This argument overlooks alternatives.</p>
        
        
              <h3>begging the question</h3>
            <p class="latin">conclusion as premise</p>
			<p>
            A mistaken conclusion of modus ponens deductive reasoning.</p>
            
            <p class="example">God exists because it says so in the Bible, which I know to be true because God wrote the Bible.</p>
            <p>The argument assumes just what it is trying to prove. In other words, the premise includes the conclusion, and therefore the premise is unreliable. This is also known as a "circular argument."</p>
            
            <h3>complex question</h3>
            <p class="latin">built-in presupposition</p>
			<p>
            A complex question poses a question in such a way that people cannot agree or disagree without committing themselves to some other claim.</p>
            
            <p class="example">Will you follow your conscience instead of your pocketbook and donate to the cause?</p>
            <p>Answering "no," regardless of their real reasons, makes someone feel guilty. Saying "yes," regardless of their real reasons, makes them noble. This kind of reasoning is not a fallacy if the implied premises are indesputable. For instance, </p>
            <p class="example">How long can one survive without water?</p>
            <p>It's presumed that after some amount of time without water, a person will not survive. However, this presupposition is valid because it's indisputably true.</p>
            
            <h3>denying the antecedent</h3>
            <p class="latin">If P, then Q. Not P. Therefore, not Q.</p>
			<p>In the valid form of modus tollens deductive reasoning, P is the antecedent to Q, and Q is consequent. Denying the antecedent P yields a different and invalid conclusion. A true conclusion is not guaranteed even if the premises are true.</p>
            <p class="example">When the roads are icy, the mail is late. <br><br>The roads are not icy.<br><br>Therefore, the mail is not late.</p>
            <p>Although the mail would be late if the roads were icy, it might be late for other reasons too. Like the the "affirming the consequence" fallacy, this argument overlooks alternatives.</p>
            
            <h3>equivocation</h3>
            <p class="latin">a.k.a. doublespeak</p>
			<p>This form of fallacy involves sliding from one meaning of a term to another in the middle of an argument</p>
            <p class="example">The priest told me to have faith. I have faith in my daughter's ability to succeed at school, so the priest should be pleased with me.</p>
            <p>The term “faith” used by the priest, was in the religious sense of believing in God without sufficient evidence, which is different from having “faith” in your daughter in which years of good past performance leads to the “faith” you might have in your daughter.</p>
            
            <h3>false dilemma</h3>
            <p class="latin">a.k.a. false dichotomy / either-or thinking</p>
			<p>Reducing the options you consider to just two often diametrically opposed.</p>
            <p class="example">America: Love it or leave it.</p>
            <p>This argument overlooks alternatives. It is possible to not love America, but still have reason not to leave the country. Ethical arguments are often prone to false dilemmas, considering only a  narrow scope of possibilities. </p>
            
            <h3>loaded language</h3>
            <p class="latin">appeal to emotion or stereotypes</p>
			<p>Substituting facts and evidence with words that stir up emotion, with the attempt to manipulate others into accepting the truth of the argument. </p>
            <p class="example">By rejecting God, you are rejecting goodness, kindness, and love itself.</p>
            
            <h3>non sequitor</h3>
            <p class="latin">"does not follow"</p>
			<p>Drawing a conclusion that is not a reasonable inference from the evidence.</p>
            <p class="example">People generally like to walk on the beach. Beaches have sand. Therefore, having sand floors in homes would be a great idea!</p>
            <p>Though the premise may be largely true, the conclusion is not logical nor defendable. This is a very bad argument.</p>
            
    
            <h3>overgeneralizing</h3>
            <p class="latin">insufficient sample</p>
			<p>Drawing a general conclusion from too few examples, or looking at incomplete or unreliable statistics. </p>
            <p class="example">96% of people in our rural farm town agree with this policy. Because it is so popular, it should be implemented on a national scale. (50 people live in our town)</p>
            <p>You can't generalize from a sample unless it is demonstrably representative.</p>
            
              <h3>persuasive definition</h3>
            <p class="latin">a.k.a. definist fallacy</p>
			<p>Defining a term in a way that may seem to be straightforward but is in fact loaded, or in way that actually makes the position easier to defend.</p>
            <p class="example">Before we argue about the truth of creationism, let’s define creationism as, “The acceptance of a set of beliefs even more ridiculous than those of flat-earthers.”</p>
            <p>Do not accept definitions put forth by the opponent unless you researched your definition on your own, and agree.</p>
            
             <h3>poisoning the well</h3>
            <p class="latin">smear tactics</p>
			<p>Using loaded language to disparage an argument before even mentioning it.</p>
            <p class="example">"Boss, you heard my side of the story why I think Bill should be fired and not me. Now, I am sure Bill is going to come to you with some pathetic attempt to weasel out of this lie that he has created.</p>
            <p>The speaker is poisoning the well by priming his boss by attacking Bill’s character (ad hominem) and setting up any defense Bill might present as “pathetic”. If the boss were to accept the advice about Bill, they, too, would be committing the fallacy.</p>
            
            <h3>post hoc</h3>
            <p class="latin">after this, therefore because of this</p>
			<p>Readily assuming causation on the basis of mere succession in time.</p>
            <p class="example">"I was doing poorly in track this season. Then I got neon laces for my shoes. Now I am winning all my races, so my laces must be lucky and if I continue to wear them I'll continue to win.</p>
            <p>This argument that doesn't take into account other possible causes for increased performance, such as more training or better diet before a race.</p>
            
            <h3>red herring</h3>
            <p class="latin">changing the subject</p>
			<p>Introducing an irrelevant or secondary subject and thereby diverting attention from the main subject. Usually the red herring is an issue which people get heated about quickly so no one notices how their attention has been diverted. </p>
            <p class="example">Son: "Wow, Dad, it's really hard to make a living on my salary." <br>Father: "Consider yourself lucky, son. Why, when I was your age, I only made $40 a week."</p>
            
            <h3>reductio ad absurdum.</h3>
            <p class="latin">"reduce to absurdity"</p>
            <p>A mode of argumentation or a form of argument in which a proposition is disproven by following its implications logically to an absurd conclusion.  Arguments which use universals such as, “always”, “never”, “everyone”, “nobody”, etc., are prone to being reduced to absurd conclusions. </p>
            <p class="example">If that is true, then pigs can fly.</p>
 
            <h3>straw man</h3>
            <p class="latin">distortion</p>
            <p>Substituting a person’s actual position or argument with a distorted, exaggerated, or misrepresented version of the position of the argument. </p>
            <p class="example">The Senator says that we should not fund the attack submarine program. I disagree entirely. I can't understand why he wants to leave us defenseless like that.</p>

                        <p>Fear and I go way back. I've been a perfectionist for as long as I can remember. You can't fail if you don't even start, right? The struggle with fear is probably the thing that has held me back more than anything else.</p>

                        <p>For a long time I was afraid that I wasn't good enough to be an "artist," so I worked boring office jobs for over a decade until the pain of not making art was greater than my fear. I slowly started making art on the side, and taking printmaking classes at a community college. The scariest thing I've ever done was leaving that stable, "good" job to return to school to finish my art degree. I had to leave it in stages, reducing my hours from 50 to 30 to 20 over a couple of years, until I finally quit. Telling my boss I was leaving was terrible. I felt like I was going to vomit, and my voice shook as I spoke to him. But after it was done, I felt like a giant weight had lifted, and I could do anything I wanted. Euphoria! I wish I had done that much sooner. I regret all of the years I wasted not working toward goals that are important to me.</p>

                        <p>Even now that I'm doing exactly the thing I wanted to do for years, fear plagues me. I worry that I'll never get a design job, or that I'll hate it, or that my skills aren't good enough, or I'm not creative enough, or that I'm too old. I worry a lot about my future. Day to day, fear sometimes gets in the way of making the things I want to make. I'm afraid what I make will be terrible, so it's easier to not start, or to wait until the last minute until I'm forced into action. I suspect this is a common problem, but it often feels like everyone else has it together, and I'm the only one who struggles with this.</p>

                        <p>Anything I've ever done that involved risk and fear has turned out great, but it's hard to remember that in the moments I'm experiencing fear. I think my work would be a lot better if I could tackle this problem, and I would probably be happier. </p></div></div>

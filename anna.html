                       <p>Back in October I suffered an acute head trauma playing the sport that I love (roller derby). It was to the degree that I had to stay home, doing nothing for a month. I couldn't use the computer or even read a book. Which meant dropping my classes and taking a lot of time off from work. Since then my brain power seems to be about half strength-- I forget things constantly (like simply words during conversations) and have to spend about twice as much time when learning new things. </p>

                        <p>I used to have very little fear of failure and now I feel myself constantly anxious that I am going to fail at every little thing-- saying the wrong word, being late to class, having my project suck, getting so dizzy that I can't continue doing a presentation, etc. I know that it's a lot of pressure to put myself under, but I can't make it stop. My brain literally won't let me. </p>

                        <p>I'm so afraid that I'm not going to be able to get through my classes and graduate. Every little molehill looks like a mountain right now. </p></div></div>

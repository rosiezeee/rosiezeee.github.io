                        <p>She had given me ample notice. One Year. She'll be marrying her now spouse for the insurance benefits. She had injured her back some time ago and has been suffering from this. I had seen her with heavy groceries carried in a stroller. I didn't believe her injury. And tonight, seeing boxes upon boxes that had once filled our apartment, there's no way anyone could have believed one with an injured back had assembled quite a fort by herself. I hadn't known how much nine years of accumulation and living looked like, now here it is. My six years of accumulation and living could not have been gleaned from the marginal organization of my room. Everything is still in place, except from a laundry bag of t-shirts to be folded, and socks to be paired and rolled in a ball. I've been meaning to store them back to the drawers, but lately, I'd been thinking, what would be the point of that. I would have to take them all out and pack them away very soon. I have a week before our last day at the apartment. She would be leaving a couple of days sooner. To bigger accommodations. With her new wife (and mother-in-law). This is what one starting a new life looks like. It had been precipitated by an injury, but decided by love.</p>

                        <p>Tomorrow, I promise, I will begin packing. I had secured a new apartment with a view of the Bay. The neighborhood had been the inspiration and model for the setting of Armistead Maupin's series of novels on San Francisco. I'll be a stone's throw away from City Lights Bookstore, a few feet from which are my favorite haunts, Vesuvius and Specs. I know I can live as a writer-of-old would with my notebooks and black hats and coats nursing a glass of something strong in a wooden table behind which I'll be sitting on a wooden bench that stretched the length of the entire bar. If one were still allowed to smoke indoors, doubtless I would be puffing away. This is how Simone de Beauvoir worked, I'll think. I can be alone, although peopled in my midst. True city living.</p>

                        <p>I know it's going to take the same getting used to as I felt when first I moved in to 1512 California Street. I remember my first evening, when I couldn't sleep, and I had texted my mother, who had cried that afternoon when I left again from a brief sojourn, that if she wanted, I can perhaps spend the next day, or the the weekend at her house. I thought I was doing her the favor. But I knew that it was for me. She had not texted me back.</p>

                        <p>I will again feel the same. Moving is a very lonely enterprise. I feel bad for those road stories of pop stars having to switch hotel rooms around the country at every performance. Never a drawer filled, as they would have to put them back into the suitcase the next morning. If I were a pop star, that would have been my rationale, I think. I wouldn't be able to bare too much moving on, too much living.</p>

                      <p>Dull thuds against the floor still carry on outside my room. An occasional stripping of boxing tape screech. Crumpling of newspapers. Sometimes a grunt, sometimes a sigh. Cabinets drawn and pushed back. None of that in my room. Everything is still in place. I could have stayed here forever if rental agreements permitted. Had it been better had I fought to stay? I don't know.</p>

                        <p>I walk back out to the back door for a smoke. The new roommates didn't know I smoked, and I must be very clandestine lest they think I had misrepresented myself. I had better take advantage now of the privilege. She had started out as a smoker, but in those six years, she had beat the habit, and is happier for it. I pass her by, busily puttering away. She had offered to me her excess newspapers. All the chinaware were hers, but I accepted. The place is still a mess. I look at those boxes and empty bookshelves and the floor dirtied with scraps of paper, and ribbons from old costume projects of hers, and dust bunnies, with a very heavy heart. It's been a year since she had made her plans. It had taken a couple of months past that year mark, but it is finally happening. My life will be changed, and what lay ahead? I don't know.</p>

                    <p>All I know is that tomorrow, I must really begin packing. All that has stayed still in this room must be packed away. A part of what was so terribly daunting is the amount of stuff I'd have to deal with. It would mean several trips to the thrift store. It would mean possibly filling up the trash bin with a lot of the stuff that I've collected. To make the move easier I would have to do a radical condensation of all this accumulation. Tomorrow I shall start. This new life needs of me the the letting go of those that I had hated, those I had been indifferent to, and more importantly, safekeeping of those that I love. Maybe tomorrow I'll even have time to look at bubble wraps and boxes. </p>

<p>I returned to my room. Sat a bit on the edge of the bed and thinking over the tide of living I had done in this room, in this apartment. There's so much of it there's not one thing I can think of that would give a picture of that life. So much. Most of it I had loved. I didn't think I did then, but I do. I wish I could stay, yes. But at the new apartment, something in my imagination has begun germinating. From all my boxes and bubble wraps I'll replace, redecorate my room. The strangeness would have dissipated, and there's something else, something new I'm about to encounter, to find out. It could be bad, it could be good. All that I don't know. But it is a carrying on, a movement, much like the great trajectory of everyone else's project in living. Who will I be now? I don't know.</p>

<p>After a moment of contemplation, I knew I had little time left before I am due for sleep. I had to be up early tomorrow morning for work. I put on my earphones for a bit of music, pulled my laundry bag toward me, and began rolling my socks in pairs. I had forgotten how relaxing it is.</p></div></div>

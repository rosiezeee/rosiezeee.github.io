                    <p>Most of the biggest "fears" that I've experienced are more psychological or personality driven, like my OCD, where I believe things that aren't. To me fear isn't something that is always in plain sight (although in 2017 it seems to be on my television a lot). To me fear is the creeping feeling that something is wrong or off, a furnace in the back of your mind that you left on. There's a prompt, then the fear feeds itself. It's somewhere but not really there, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Then the anxiety comes. And the dread. It bleeds into your day, hurts your interactions with people. Some hours your workload becomes inexistent and you feel like you're trapped in your own personal purgatory.</p>

                    <p>Needless to say, it fucking sucks.</p>

<p>In my experience the only way to deal with it is to confront it. Accept it. Let it scare parts of you until you can take the control the fear has taken back. Then you punch that fear in its face.</p></div></div>

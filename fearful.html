                           <p>I lost my brother and many friends before the age of twenty-one. I am fearful of those moments when all is lost and you don't know what to do, who to turn to, or when to speak up. I am fearful of losing someone so valuable to something that could've been prevented. I am fearful of my dreamt up kids not knowing their uncle. I am fearful of those who do not open up, who are incapable of putting trust in others, and who do not believe that they can make a difference. </p><p>I am fearful of the future for it is dark just like the past. I am most fearful of knowing that I haven't faced the worst of it. Fear is a word we use when we don't know what to say. It reflects the past, present, and future. Fear is a threat we make up for ourselves. I am fearful in accepting these things.</p></div></div>

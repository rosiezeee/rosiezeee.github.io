                        <p>Many people know that I am afraid of bears. And to me, it is a very rational fear; they can swim faster than me, climb higher than me, and certainly catch me in a foot race if they wanted to tear my face off. If I ever came face-to-face with a bear, I would surely die.</p>

<p>I think I am so afraid of bears because I believe that there is no chance for me. I am unable to even humour the situation wherein I retreat with dignity, slowly back away, and escape a bear encounter without a scratch. To me, no matter what, I will lose. The bear will defeat me 100% of the time. </p>

<p>I have come to discover, though, that this very specific fear of bears manifests as a deeper fear of inadequacy. I am afraid that no matter how hard I try, I will fail. No matter how good I am, there is someone better. The world is a bear, and I just can’t defeat it.</p>

<p>My rational fear of bears permeates my life as a skewed evaluation of my own capabilities. It’s the comparison of Bear vs. Teresa that I am afraid of. If I let go of the ‘vs. Teresa’, then perhaps I could be freer of the unnecessary comparisons and irrational match-ups in the rest of my life. Maybe then I could begin to feel enough, such as capable enough to survive a bear encounter even one time out of a hundred.</p></div></div>

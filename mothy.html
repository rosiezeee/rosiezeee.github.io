                        <p>When I was four or five years old, my mom and I were in the kitchen after dark. We heard a fluttering noise by the fridge, and realize that a moth had gotten into the house. Not just any moth though&mdash;one of those gigantic moths with the fake eyes on their wings. We started laughing at the magnitude of this moth, trying to chase it out of the house with a towel, when finally we herded it over to the door. Suddenly, everything changed in the blink of an eye. I was outside, the moth followed. My mom shut the door behind us. Fear began to well inside me as I realized the door was held shut, and I was out here with the moth that Godzilla always fights. It fluttered around my head, searching for light to feed off of. I looked up and through my tears I saw my mom laughing at this entire ordeal. I was finally let into the house, but my fear of moths followed me into the house as well that night. To this day, I get the chills thinking about them, I get jumpy when I see them because of their unpredictable movements, and my mom denies ever keeping me out there with that beast. I don't think I'll ever look at a moth the same way as long as I live. </p></div></div>

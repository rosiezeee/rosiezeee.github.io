        <h1>Citing Sources</h1>
	</header>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Unfortunately, nobody is an expert on everything there is to know. It would be impossible to know firsthand facts about ancient times about remote locales where we have never been. We must rely on others to tell us much of what we need to know about the world. Relying on others for this kind of information can be risky. When we use this kind of information to support our claims in argument, we must consider a checklist of standards for truly authoritative sources. </h2>
		
        
        <article>
            <h3>1. Cite your sources</h3>
			<p>
            Some factual assertions are so obvious or well-known that they do not need citation. For example, it is not necessssary to prove that there are 50 states in the United States. It would be necessary, however, to cite a figure of the current population of the U.S.</p>
            <h3>2. Seek informed sources</h3>
			<p>
            Sources must be qualified to make the statements they make. Honda mechanics are qualified to discuss the merits of different Hondas. Midwives are qualified to discuss childbirth. Teachers are qualified to discuss their school. And so on. These sources are qualified because they have the appropriate background and information. Keep in mind that depending on your topic, an authority source may not be the best informed source. For instance, if you are investigating the merits of a university, a student may be better informed than an administrator. </p>
		
            <h3>3. Seek impartial sources</h3>
                <p>People who have a lot at stake in a dispute are usually not the best sources of information about the issues in involved. Look for sources from people or organizations who are not deeply invested in the immediate issue, but still have prior and primary interest in accuracy. For instance:</p>
            <p class="example">
            My car dealer recommends that I pay $300 to rustpoof my car. He should know; I guess I'd better do it.</p>
            <p>In this scenario, the dealer may have knowledge, but he may not be the most reliable. It is in his interest to sell you a service. Research information from non-affiliated parties.   </p>
            
            <h3>4. Cross-check sources</h3>
                <p>
                Consult and compare a variety of sources to see if other, equally good authorities agree. Are experts sharply divided or in agreement? Authorities are most likely to agree on factual matters. On larger and less tangible issues, it is harder to to find authorities who agree. You may still quote them if you know their audience agrees and respect with them, but do not expect their mere assertions to carry authority. Nor does mere disagreement disqualify a source. Although there was a time when experts disagreed about global climate change, the world scientific community is now nearly unanimous that it is occurring and needs to be addressed. There may be controversy, but not among experts. </p>
            
            <h3>5. Use the web with care</h3>
                <p>The web can provide information on almost any question or issue. Reliability is quite another matter. On the web anyone can say anything whatsoever. Only rely on web sources that are independently reputable. Consider who created the site, why they created it, and what there qualifications are. The best online information is found in databases or academic resources not accessible from standard search engines. </p>

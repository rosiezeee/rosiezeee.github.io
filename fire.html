                         <p>On July 7, 1986 I was set on fire by my mom's boyfriend. I spent months in and out of the hospital, more surgeries than I can remember. It changed my life forever and started my addiction to drugs. When I told my mother, she didn't believe me, and I not only went home to this person, he became the care giver and was the one to change bandages and clean the wounds. I have scars on my neck, arm and chest where I was burned to bone.</p>

                            <p>How I overcame this.... Well I still am very uncomfortable around large fires...I don't think I will ever go camping. But I can start a small contolled fire in a fire place or grill if I have a large bucket of water or a fire extinguisher close by. Gas fire places no longer bother me. Mind you all of this has happened in the last couple years and started by turning on a gas fire place and then turning it off when I just couldn't handle it anymore. The next day I would do it for longer. Then when that was no longer so scary I went to a gas grill and did the same thing. Then a fireplace. Which was the hardest. I threw alot of water and my shop vac got alot of use. I still panic when I feel that it;s too big. Why did I do this you might ask? 1. That man who hurt me can't win. I can't let his actions dictate my life. He doesn't get that control. 2. My kids grew up knowing I didn't do fire. I can still see thier faces when I not only started one but had them make smores. His actions don't get to impact their lives.</p>

                            <p>Side note becuase everyone asks. The man who set me on fire died when I was 18. He was run over by a train. My mother never believed me, and I didn't tell anyone else for years. I got sober when I was 16 and have been sober since. I can light candles, I don't do it often. My kids always had candles to blow out on their birthday, even when doing so would give me panic attaks and nightmares.</p></div></div>

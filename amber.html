                        <p>Trembling, I crawled up the granite, placed another piece of protection, and then down climbed to a perch I could rest without falling. I was on a beginners rock climb in Squamish, British Columbia and feeling totally crippled with fear. Shakey Elvis leg..short breath...frantic movements...glances pleading at the ground. My climbing partner yelled up the obvious, "I think fear is dominating your climbing." I thought to myself, I think fear is dominating my life. </p>
<p>That year I graduated from college and I moved to Seattle with my partner to start a new job. Turns out starting a new job in a new city with a partner feels a lot like Elvis leg and short breaths with lots of glances towards the ground. I was afraid that I was again and again missing the train in the direction of my future, yet unsure where I wanted it to arrive. </p>
<p>My climbing partners comment awoke me slowly. A few days later, I sat in the grass, listening to a favorite band playing. I'd looked forward to this concert, yet I sat still, nervous, listening. My new boss sat next to me conjuring all my feelings of self doubt and confusion. Only a few brave souls were dancing, and I wanted to join them, but then I would become human and vulnerable. I was so afraid of my life I couldn't dance. </p>
<p>Somehow then, I stood up, and walked into the field below the stage. I moved a little, then a little more, and more, until I was full with Rhythm, my dress swaying, my feet stained green. I danced about every insecurity, every doubt, every relationship, every missed and yet to come opportunity. In body shapes I said I will not let fear dominate my life and I became free. </p></div></div>

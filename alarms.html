                        <p>Ever since I was a child I've been afraid of Fire Alarms. I'm not entirely sure why, perhaps its the sudden jolt you get when it starts and the continual annoying noise that persists as it continues. Either way, I was terrified of them.</p> <p>It came to a head when I was in 6th grade. The principal liked to maintain constant scheduling so the fire drills were always on the first Thursday of the month, always in the morning. It was always at that time when my class was scheduled to go to the computer lab. On those mornings we solemnly would walk in a line across the school, quiet as not to disturb the other classes. The computer lab was in a large room, there was one alarm in there right above where I was assigned to sit. At first I knew nothing of the scheduling, the lead up to the alarm going off was peaceful, and the eventual sounding of the alarms surprising. However, once I caught wind of the scheduling it became pure torture. We would walk in, I would beg my teacher not to sit me there, but to seat me on the other side of the room She always refused, and as always the alarm went off. I did not have a fun time in 6th grade. </p><p>For me the true fear is anticipation, that something bad will happen, a loud noise, or something more even more sinister. </p></div></div>

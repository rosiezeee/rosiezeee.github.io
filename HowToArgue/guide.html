        <h1>General Guidelines</h1>

	<section>
		<h2>Arguments are often unpleasant, pointless, or overly emotional. These kinds of arguments occur when one or both parties are simply stating prejudices, working with unsound premises, citing invalid sources, or asserting fallacious claims. The following general guidelines will help produce arguments that are not just verbal fistfights, but are instead productive supports of certain views using sound logical reasoning.</h2>
		
        
        <article>
            <h3>1. Identify premises and conclusion</h3>
			<p>
            Define what is is you are trying to prove, and what your conclusion is. Sometimes there will be more than one conclusion. Keep in mind that you may have to try more than one argument before you find an argument that leads to your desired conclusion.</p>
            <h3>2. Develop your ideas in a natural order</h3>
			<p>
            To flesh out a short argument in writing, begin with your conclusion, followed by your reasons. Set out your ideas in an order that unfolds your line of thought most clearly for the reader. Consider this short argument by philosopher Bertrand Russell: </p>
            <p class="example">
            
            The evils of the world are due to moral defects quite as much as to lack of intelligence. But the human race has not hitherto discovered any method of eradicating moral defects... Intelligence, on the contrary, is easily improved by methods known to every competent educator. Therefore, until some methods of teaching virtue has been discovered, progress will have to be sought by improvement of intelligence rather than of morals.</p>
            
            <p> Each sentence leads smoootly the way for the next. Russel begins by pointing out two sources of evil in the world: "moral defects" and lack of intelligence. He then claims that we do not know how to correct "moral defects" but that we do know how to correct intelligence. Thefore, we can come by progress only by correcting intelligence. Getting an argument to unfold in this manner is an accomplishment.</p>
		
            <h3>3. Start from reliable premises</h3>
                <p>
                No matter how well you argue from premises to conclusion, your conclusion will be weak if your premises are weak. A premise may be strengthened through research, or through an argument for the premise itself. If you cannot argue for your premise, try another premise!</p>
            
            <h3>4. Be concrete and concise</h3>
                <p>
                Avoid abstract, vague, and general terms. Wordiness, flowery language, or beating around the bush are a sure way to confuse and lose your audience.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Build on substance, not overtone</h3>
                <p>Offer actual reasons, not just overtones and connotations of certain words.</p>
            <p class="example">
            
            Having so disgracefully allowed her once-proud passenger railroads to fade into obscurity, America is now honor bound to restore them.</p>
            <p>This argument uses emotionally-loaded language. The problem isn't in the argument itself, but in its lack of actual evidence. </p>

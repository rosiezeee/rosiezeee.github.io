                    <p>this is not mine.</p>

<p>i've known this since before i was breathing this air. when my mother still held me in her. this fear is not ours. </p>

<p>yet, we inhabit it. it inhabits us. we have volunteered, in unremembered previous lifetimes, to be in these bodies. this fear blesses us in ways we are not meant to understand in totality. yet.</p>

<p>an overstimulated vagus nerve. missing-the-mark programmed frontal lobe pathways. spirally whipsmart microbes. on-switches. </p>

<p>they tell me how to cope: the breathing. the soil-filled capsules. the white dissolving powder. the yellow pills. the dissociation. the years. none of it really feels like you. none of it feels like the life breathed into the nerve. the nerve asks for other forms of sustenance. these forms are nuanced. and not meant to be understood. yet. </p>

<p>this is not mine. and yet here we are. in this body. </p>

<p>you have already revealed yourself as mine to meet. to begin to understand. and to court. and to pummel. you will show me how to love you into calm waves and receive all that's meant to come from you. </p>

<p>we will integrate. you won't be called "fear" anymore. you will be me.  </p></div></div>

                    <p>1. Cry. At the person who may or may not have made you pregnant, at your friends, at your mom.</p>
<p>2. Practice how to say "Where can I obtain a dangerous back alley abortion procedure? Do you have a guy?" (¿Donde podemos abortar esta cosa en mi útero? ¿Conoce alguien?)</p>
<p>3. Stop crying at the person who may or may not have made you pregnant. Walk down the dirt road to get tacos, even though they only have meat ones at this place because secretly you kind of like pork. Think about a tiny fetus who may or may not exist eating tacos in your uterus.
<p>4. Google "how many days past period pregnant"
<p>5. "can you get pregnant if you use a condom"
<p>6. "has trump made abortion illegal yet"
<p>7. Try to do an activity not related to worrying, like reading a book in Spanish or writing in your journal or shopping for pineapple. 
<p>8. Eventually go back to googling for awhile.
<p>9. Think about how pregnant women always say they just ‘knew’ when they were pregnant. What does it feel like to just ‘know’? Like this? Or is this cramps?
<p>10. Start a new list of 10 things scarier than being pregnant in a country that has banned abortion:
<div class="indentlist"><p>1. Being pregnant with twins</p>
<p>2. The current state of US politics (Is this related? Maybe.)</p>
<p>3. HIV/AIDS</p>
<p>4. Rabies</p>
<p>5. Getting lost in the jungle at night. Reminisce with the person who may or may not have made you pregnant about the time you got lost in the jungle at night, right before the action that may or may not have made you pregnant. You mention the eyes you swear you both saw peering out of the bushes. He mentions that you definitely had a panic attack in a mud puddle. You decide this experience was definitely scarier than the one you are having right now.</p>
<p>6. Dengue fever</p>
<p>7. Not having health insurance</p>
<p>8. Getting deported from the US</p>
<p>9. Trying to get refugee status to enter the US</p>
<p>10. Getting pregnant in a country than has banned abortion and not being able to fly back to the US to get one.</p></div>
<p>11. Go to the beach and swim in the ocean even though it’s the Pacific and the olas are giant and scary. Float around, get tumbled, get salt in your teeth and hair and eyes.</p>
<p>12. Acknowledge that nobody is judging you.</p>
<p>13. Acknowledge that you are safe.</p>
<p>14. Wish desperately for a guitar.</p>
<p>15. Check your underwear.</p>
<p>16. Cry.</p>
<p>17. Repeat.</p>

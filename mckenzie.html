<p>I have a thing for vertical surfaces. Granite cracks and sheer walls of sandstone raise my heartrate in way no romance ever will. Basically, I am one of those folks with a bizarre inclination to spend time climbing up and down big rocks, exploring the axis that runs between the soil and the sky. </p>
<p>Climbing is a funny game. For most climbers, our little privileged lives are so good that we get to go out and intentionally make them harder for a moment. We spend the day lugging our ant bodies upward, grunting our way through the ascent of some alluring chunk of rock. Often, these walls even have an easier way to walk up the backside of the hill, but there’s just something so vivifying about tip-toe dancing up the side of a cliff that we opt for the harder route up.  Sure, the view at the summit is pretty, but for me, climbing is more about the process of getting to the top. You know, “it’s about the journey, man.” </p>
<p>Climbing is both a physical and a mental challenge. Sometimes, it feels like tranquilly solving a puzzle using your body. Other times, it feels like fighting a battle with a rock face. What’s funny about feeling as though the rock has defeated you, is that really you’ve only been defeated by yourself. After all, you are the one who dragged your butt up that rock to begin with, dummy. The rock is apathetic, it doesn’t care if it physically tears holes in your fingers or if it reduces you mentally to a blubbering pulp. Whether you make it to the top and get to beat your chest on the summit or whether you tie your knots wrong and plummet to your death are of no consequence to the big ol’ slab of stone. A lot of the time, climbing makes me feel electrically joyful, but some of the time climbing makes my sphincter go vacuum sealed tight and I am utterly terrified. This fear when climbing is a fairly complicated thing for me.</p> 
<p>It feels like there are two different breeds of fear that I experience while climbing: fears triggered by external things and fears triggered by internal things. The fears triggered by external things category includes: fear of falling a really long ways, fear of falling rocks or rocks breaking when on loose terrain, fear of the rope going over something too sharp and breaking, fear that I did not place my gear well enough for it to hold me, and fear of something going wrong due to the inability to communicate with my climbing partner (thanks to wind or distance or some other noise-dampening force). The fears triggered by internal things category is a lot slipperier. It is all tangled up with my ego, habits, expectations, commitment, relationships, and trust in myself.  </p>
<p>A tremendous contributing factor toward my internal fears in climbing is my expectation about what I should and shouldn’t be capable of climbing. My past experiences with different styles of climbing, types of rock, or difficulty levels of climbs dictates what I expect going into a new climb. If the climb is a style of climbing that I have previously struggled on or is a difficulty level that I have not done before, I am liable to be pre-emptively fearful that I will have a hard time with it. When climbing routes that I expect to be challenging, I find myself tempted to hang on climbing gear and procrastinate on attempting moves that I expect will be difficult for me. All of this anxiety goes on in my head before I even try the moves to find out if they are actually even hard or not. It is almost as though my expectation that a climb will be difficult makes it so. I want the experience of succeeding at something prior to trying a similar thing, since that experience makes me feel like my success on this new thing is more likely. This dependency on past experience and expectation about future ability traps me within my comfort zone. Part of the joy of climbing is cavorting with the unknown. Embracing the unknown requires letting go of expectations, or at least not allowing them to paralyze me when attempting something challenging. </p>
<p>This expectation of challenge relates to ego and the fear of failure which are both massively relevant in my climbing. Sometimes the fear of failure is perfectly reasonable, rooted in actual physical risk of a bad fall if I don’t successfully execute a climbing move. However, there is often no serious physical consequence for not making a move, so the fear of failure can only be explained by the fact that failing puts my ego at risk. I find myself half-assing climbing moves, giving up before giving it my all, and sometimes even refusing to try a route because of the fear that I won’t be able to do it. I think I do this because it is easier on the ego to fail on my own terms without properly trying, than to try my darndest and still fail anyways. </p>
<p>Another factor that contributes tremendously to my fear while climbing is the relationship between me and whomever I am climbing with. Climbing is a partner sport, and there’s nothing quite like hanging off a cliff face to force you to get chummy with someone. When I am climbing with someone I am close to and comfortable with, I am more likely to try climbing something that is out of my comfort zone. I am confident that even if I struggle on it, they know me well enough that they will not judge me based on my climbing. On the other hand, when I’m climbing with someone I’ve just recently met I am less likely to push myself. I think this is because with newer climbing partners, it is not unusual for our relationship thus far to be based primarily on climbing. The fact that they do not know me outside of climbing makes me fearful that they will craft their opinions of me based on how I climb around them. </p>
<p>I also experience social fears related to climbing when I am climbing with people who are very good climbers or who take climbing very seriously, even if they are close friends whom I am comfortable around.  When I see that someone highly values their climbing performance, I feel afraid that they will evaluate my climbing performance with the same criticality. This makes me afraid to challenge myself around them for fear that I will struggle and appear physically or mentally weak. I fear that appearing weak around them will cause them to think less of me. </p>
<p>I already discussed how my fear is affected by expectations about my climbing ability; my fear is also affected by my expectations about what it is like to climb with a particular person. I think that I unconsciously create behavioral habits that are affected by who I am climbing with. If I have mostly felt strong, capable, calm, and empowered while climbing with a certain partner, I am more likely to feel the same way when climbing with them again. If I have historically felt weak, cowardly, and insecure when climbing with a different partner, than I have an inclination to fall more easily into that same mind frame when climbing with them. </p>
<p>Here, I should pause to clarify something: I have used the words success and failure a lot so far. For me in climbing, these are not defined simply. They are such fuzzy concepts that it would perhaps be best not to even use them at all, but Thesaurus.com hasn’t provided me with suitable alternatives. Success for me in climbing does not merely mean executing a move without falling or making it to the top of a climb. Rather, it is more about the way that I engage with a climb while I am on it. It is about how I exercise mental control in the face of fear and about how I exert maximum effort for things that are physically difficult. It is also largely about whether or not I can make it up and back down a wall safely. It is possible to technically “fail” at making it to the top of a climb, but to feel like I succeeded by trying hard, remaining in control, and making good judgement decisions based on risk and my skillset. On the other hand, I feel like I have failed when I allow fear to dominate me. When I lose control of my fear and shut down, I leave the climb feeling as though I have failed. It is also possible to technically “succeed” at making it to the top of a climb but to feel as though I failed due to the manner in which I behaved on the climb. For me, losing control of my fear is a little bit like getting drunk. I end up in a physically and mentally altered state of consciousness that I cannot quickly will myself out of. Once it happens, I am physically and mentally in a place of such heightened anxiety that I cannot just easily snap out of it. When my emotions are running rampant, I can remember what it feels like to be in control, but I cannot instantly return to that state. For me, things work better if I don’t allow my fear to get out of control in the first place. </p>
<p>In climbing there are occasions where losing control of fear is not an option. When actual risk of a dangerous fall is combined with challenging climbing it is crucial to calmly confront fear and embrace commitment. Sometimes the only way out of a dodgy place is by continuing upwards. In these situations, when there is no option to bail, the privilege to panic is gone. Here, for me, something miraculous occasionally happens: fear is transformed into pure focus. Whether it involves holding my weight on a credit card thin shard of stone or gingerly balancing across a mostly blank slab of rock, when committing fully is the only option, I am always astounded to find out what I am capable of. </p>
<p>I am still learning to discern where the line is marking the risk versus my ability versus my comfort zone versus my fear.  I strive to challenge myself mentally and physically, but my highest priority is making sound decisions about what climbs are appropriate for me. I hope to keep climbing until I’m a blue haired old lady and that requires making good judgements up until then. I think it is acceptable to take risks while climbing. I am okay with doing climbs that have moments where a fall could be catastrophic. However, it is important for me to know myself well enough to trust that I will not to fall in those places. I will save trying things that are at the absolute edge of my ability for climbs where falling would be safe. Attempting these types of climbs forces me to grapple with internal fears related to failure and ego. </p>
<p>I think that fear in climbing is really just a continuation of fear of the unknown. Snakes and cats are scary because they can’t be trusted to behave predictably, the future is scary because no matter how much you plan anything could happen, committing to a person is scary because people’s wishes, dreams, desires, and wants change. For me, climbing is scary because I don’t know how hard a new route will be or if I will be physically and mentally up for the challenge. The unknown is frightening because we like to have a handle on things, control over things. Stepping into the unknown inherently requires us to surrender that control. I suppose that may be exactly what leaving your comfort zone means, letting go of a certain amount of control. In that liminal space between the edge of our comfort zone and complete mental disarray, I think we get to know ourselves better.</p>

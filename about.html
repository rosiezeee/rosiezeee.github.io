                <p>This project is my thesis project in graphic design from Portland State University. I began exploring the topic of fear when I noticed it becoming a bigger part of my life in the past year or so. I became nervous about driving in cars, I worried about weirdos breaking into my house in the night, I doubted the viability of my career, and I questioned whether my relationships were healthy or reciprocal. The fear crept into my art and design as well. Was I a good enough designer? Did people like my work? What if I can't draw well enough? What if a client doesn't get my work? What if people think I'm stupid?</p>
            
                    
                <p>I decided I wanted to learn about fear. And, I wanted to hear other peoples' fears. Fears are vulnerabilities, and even though they may be real and true, I think we often hesitate to share them. So I decided to ask people, friends and strangers, to tell their fear stories.</p>
                    
                <p>I wondered if by sharing our fears we could begin to identify and reflect on their meanings. And by reading others' fears, be reminded that we are not alone in our demons.</p> 
                    
                 <p>I wanted to create a gallery that would show these sometimes dark stories as stories of empowerment and light.</p>

                <p>Everybody feels fear of some form or another. Evolutionarily, fear helps us identify when we are in danger. Fear is a natural response to a threat, and is usually met with a fight or flight reaction. But what happens when the threat exists only in our minds? I learned that fear is a feeling. It is an emotional response. And feelings are cultural constructs&mdash;how we react emotionally is a function of the culture we were raised in. And just as culture is fluid, and emotions are fluid, so is fear.</p> <p>For me, this was an empowering realization. Fear is not something that is set in stone. It can be relearned, through practice and mindset.</p>
    
                <p>There are many fears that are absolutely rational and legitimate. There are many good reasons to be afraid and it is important to listen to those feelings. But some of our fears are stories that we tell ourselves. These fears hold dark alternate universes we have invented and convinced ourselves are real. These are the kinds of fears that hold us back from realizing our full potential&mdash;as artists, as employees, as friends and family members, as activists, as lovers, and as thriving humans. But fear is only a feeling. And like happiness, sadness, or anger, fear can be turned on its head. </p>
                <p>One of my main takeaways from this project is that fear and failure are necessary parts of our process&mdash;whether that process is a creative process or the process of our own growth.</p>

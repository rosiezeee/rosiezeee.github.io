                        <p>"Act as if" is one of my favorite platitudes. I was a teenager when I first heard it, from a friend's Mom, who I met in High School. She was newly in recovery / AA. Had been a cocaine doing / whiskey drinking elementary school teacher, and she was funny, wise, dry, candid and warm. Something happened to get her to recovery, but I don't know what. She told me to act as if. She was in her first few years of sobriety and when she met me I was a 16-year-old extrovert living timidly. I was terrified to tell my parents the truth—that I didn't believe in what they believed in. I had tried—and it had never gone well, so I went along with the game. </p>

                        <p>Honesty always made my life harder, and more restricted, so my life became about compliance and illusions. I made my thoughts invisible, I hid records, snuck in secret boyfriends late at night through my window. I got a file cabinet that had a locked drawer for all my notes and writings. I got a post office box to get records, zines, and letters from friends. I lived in fear of discovery because I didn't want to have love withheld or be sent away. The fear was a constant companion, a knot in the gut. I was just a secular teen in love with punk rock culture. I wish it was an act of bravery that broke me out of my hiding and my shame, but it wasn't. That Mom told me I could 'act as if' and have something different, that I didn't need to live a lie. </p>

                        <p>After I turned 18 I was supposed to become an evangelical missionary student in another town. I knew it couldn't happen. I didn't know how to say so, but I knew how to survive, and so that's what I did. I packed up everything I owned, and acted as if I owned my own life, and I disappeared from that house, on that gravel road, in that crappy small town. I was released from the fear of being found out and the illusion was blown apart. I got free. </p></div></div>

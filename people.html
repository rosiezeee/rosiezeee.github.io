                    <p>I have a fear of not being good enough. Throughout my childhood my family, my friends, all the people in my life would talk about my appearance as some sort of achievement. When I was 10 I hit a really awkward stage with all the hardships of becoming a pre teen and I gained a significant amount of weight, grew 4 inches in one summer, my face got pimply, and I realized that being a pretty person isn’t going to get me anywhere.</p> <p>When I no longer felt pretty, things changed. I realized that being female, I especially had to work hard to be taken seriously despite what I looked like. A couple years later I grew up a little bit and out of this stage of self doubt, lost the weight, got contacts, the braces came off, and once again people started treating me differently. I had a full 90s teen flick transformation, that when you take the glasses off the girl she’s suddenly something to be desired.</p><p>I have this huge fear that I’m actually not successful at what I do or how I do it, that people treat me well because of my genes and how I present myself. I have always struggled between rejecting things that are typically feminine and loving them. My feminist self wants to hate the beauty industry, but I actually really love putting on makeup and I love doing my nails and I love talking about hair and clothes. I really love it but sometimes it all feels so vapid. What would happen if all that went away? When I get older? If I don’t have the time or money to take care of my appearance, what then?</p><p>I think I try and battle this fear by really applying myself to things academically, I want to have a backup when I need it. I want to be smart AND _____. No matter how much I try to convince myself that I don’t rely on what others think of me, that want to impress others is always kind of there.</p></div></div>

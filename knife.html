                        <p>My Dad picks me up from my house in the early afternoon. We leave sunny clear-skied Portland on I-84, heading east. We have a loose plan of our route, but we are both improvising. We aim to drive to the Idaho border, or as close as we can get before nightfall. My Dad and I are cut of a similar cloth when it comes to traveling, in that we are pretty unconcerned with rigorous schedules, and love to explore backroads and make impromptu diversions.</p>
                    
<p>I hadn’t seen my Dad in quite a few months. He lives on the Northern California coast. The first few hours in the car we catch up, talking about my school, his projects, family affairs, my job, and current events. In a few hours, we make it to La Grande. We stop for an ice cream cone. The sun is low in the sky, that late summer golden glow.</p>

<p>The day before, I had looked up a campsite for our first night’s destination. It was on the edge of the Wallowa National Forest, a plain but accessible State Park. It seemed like it was popular and would be easy to find.</p>

<p>We take off out of La Grande onto smaller highways. The yellow grassy freeway landscape is replaced by roads narrow and winding, and the sun hangs low on the mauve horizon.  I start to see sage brush, the sweet signal of the nearby desert.
We are chatting, distractedly. Eventually I realized my Dad has taken a wrong turn. Oh well, we check the map and are able to loop back around on some new backroads. The terrain grows remote. It is mysterious and privy.</p><p>We pass through a tiny town called Medical Springs, located in the elbow crook of a bending road. There are but a few houses and parked old cars. There is a pool surrounded by a chainlink fence. Not a shiny Los Angeles pool, but an old gray pool, full of matte water trickling in through a rusty conduit. We muse at the pool, wondering if it really has healing properties. I want to stop and look, but the town feels private. There is no general store, no gas station, no signal to outsiders that stopping and looking around would not be intrusive and rude. A couple of looky-loos from the city ogling at the curiosity of rural life...</p>
<p>The sun has almost set, and we see the National Forest Sign, suggesting we are close to our destination. Then, we realize something is up. We have a flat tire. Well, it’s not completely flat, but it’s losing air. We don’t know exactly how far we are from camp, so we opt to fix the tire. By the time we jack it up, put on the spare, and stow the flat, we have lost the light. </p>
              
<p>Back on the road, we quickly lose cell signal. My brief directions tell us that the campground is off a forest road that spurs off from the highway. We know we are close, less than ten miles, and pass many unmarked forest roads. I had assumed the State Park would be clearly signposted, but we drive on and see no signs. We turn around, thinking that perhaps we missed the sign, but the dirt roads just seem to trickle off into the dark woods. It’s after 10pm. Finally, we decide that we will just pull off onto one of the unmarked roads and camp anywhere.</p>

<p>We drive 5 miles up a road to the first small pullout. The woods are blindingly dark. My flashlight is swarmed by moths and mosquitoes. We skip dinner, and set up the truck's rooftop tent. I fall asleep fast. Only to be awoken by a strange sound, like radio static, accompanied by crunching footsteps on the gravel outside. </p>
              
<p>Instantly, I am wide awake. I turn to my Dad. He puts his finger to his lips. We are silent. It is impossible to see out of the tent, so we are relying on sound alone. The footsteps sound like they are circling the truck, directly below our rooftop perch. My heart pounds. The radio and footsteps grow quieter, going down the road away from us. My Dad whispers to me, "I’ve been up listening to him walk back and forth up and down the road for the last 45 minutes." My heart pounds harder.</p>
              
<p>The footsteps get louder again, now coming back up the road. I grab my Dad’s hand, suddenly reverted to a child. I am shaking. We are in the middle of nowhere rural Eastern Oregon, 5 miles off an unmarked road. We haven’t seen another car in hours, not even while we were changing the tire by the side of the highway. Who is out there? What are they doing?</p>

<p>The footsteps faded up the road again, but my ears were hearing the footsteps in every rustle of the tent fabric and every gust of wind in the trees. My Dad says something mildly reassuring.</p>

<p>Just as we start to relax, we hear them yet again, coming back down the road. The crunch of gravel grows closer, louder, closer, louder. In my wildest nightmare, there is not one man, but five. I imagine it was not one man going back and forth, but a number of men assembling around us, all holding rifles cocked and aimed upward at the tent, waiting for us to stick our heads out of the zippered flap.</p>

<p>My Dad whispers to me, "Do you want me to do something?" I am incredulous. "What?" I ask. "Do what?"</p>

              <p>"I am going to say something," he says.</p><p>My Dad starts to put shoes on. I am freaking out. As a woman, especially with a reserved personality, I am inclined to hide in these kinds of situations, not seek an altercation. So when my Dad asks me if I want him to do something, my mind reels. To me the prospect is so terrifying, I can not even wrap my mind around it. My fear has paralyzed and suboordinated me. I am not able to act, let alone have an opinion about how I want my father to act. </p>

                    <p>He grabs a flashlight, and pokes his out of the tent. "What’s going on out there?" he calls. </p>

<p>I am frozen, anticipating what will happen next. A gruff man’s voice calls back curtly, "I’m lookin' for my knife." </p>

<p>Needless to say, my fears spiked. "You seen my knife?" the man says, "It’s a KA-Bar S military knife. I think I dropped it along the road." I calmed down slightly. So he's lost something, okay. But of all the scary objects to search for in the middle of the night...</p> <p></p>

<p>"No," my Dad replies, "We didn’t see a knife." He pauses. "Are you camping around here?"</p>

<p>"Just up the road," the voice says. Another pause. "Well if you find a knife will you pick it up for me?"</p>

<p>Sure thing, Buddy. Sure thing....</p>
<p>I don't know how I would have reacted if I had been alone. What if I were with female friends? In this instance, I let my imagination go wild, and it completely dominated my mind and body. But a part of me wonders if my imagination wasn't quite so far-fetched. I mean, he was looking for a knife made to kill bears! </p>
